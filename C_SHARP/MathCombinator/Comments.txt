//instead of logging, in most cases I am just writing to console, though logging should be added at a later date
//the two exception are throws that need to be handled; file extension not known and attempting to print unevaluated data
//though the latter of the two could evaluate the data ahead of time
//but I left it this way under the assumption that this may end up being used in a thread based system
//where evaulation may be computationaly bound
//I also left, as practice for the reader, a way to add trinary or unary operations in pretty simply
//you would have to add the appropriate class/function combination
//the dictionary for the evaulators
//and add in how it would be read by whatever system you want
//As I believe that it goes beyond the scope of the document. It would be a place where communication between
//automation and the product owner would take place as to the exact way that this should be handled
//I am also specifically trying not to use inheritance in this as it has some weird pitfalls for extensibility


//I decided that "twenty" is not valid data for this test, as it was not covered in the document
//if you would want to allow it as actual text, there are decently sized converters and code documentation online
//however that appeared to be outside of the scope of the test

//it would be trivial to place some .splits to remove the "TURN10" that shows up in the descriptor; I will leave that for the reader
